# Unit test are configured to start with -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000
# To run a test from IDE, you need to specify agentlib as well.
# Sometimes it is convenient to run a test in debug mode - then remove agentlib, but hotswap command will not work
# and you need to modify the test accordingly (e.g. replace with Thread.sleep(10000) and modify target the class
# from IDE via standard hotswap process.
