/**
 * Track references to arbitrary objects using proxy and weak references. To
 * monitor a handle, one should call {@link #monitor(Object, ReleaseListener)},
 * with the given handle object usually being a holder that uses the target
 * object underneath, and the release listener performing cleanup of the target
 * object once the handle is not strongly referenced anymore.
 *
 * <p>
 * When a given handle becomes weakly reachable, the specified listener will be
 * called by a background thread. This thread will only be started lazily and
 * will be stopped once no handles are registered for monitoring anymore, to be
 * restarted if further handles are added.
 *
 * <p>
 * Thanks to Tomasz Wysocki for the suggestion and the original implementation
 * of this class!
